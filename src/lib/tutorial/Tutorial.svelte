    Hello Mayor, and welcome to the location of our new Town! All of us are just getting started
    here ourselves. We haven't even placed a single card yet!
  </p>
  <p>
    I have the card for a <CardRef id="cat-neighbourhood" /> right here, I'll put it into your deck.
    Since you're in charge here, I'll let you see about setting that up for us. Start by opening up the
    deck view.
  </p>
  <p class="info">The button to open the deck view is at the bottom right.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Of course!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={deckView}>
  <p>
    This is the deck view; the cards you see here are yours. There are all sorts of cards to be
    collected, each one providing a different function. I'm sure you'll soon have a whole collection
    and turn this town into a great place to live!
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, we just need to set up that <CardRef id="cat-neighbourhood" /> for your citizens to live
    in.
  </p>
  <p class="info">Click a card to drop it into the world.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Got it!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={arrangeNeighbourhood}>
  <p>
    The <CardRef id="cat-neighbourhood" /> is now on the field, but it's sitting loose. Make sure to
    properly set into the grid to ensure that it stays put.
  </p>
  <p class="info">Click and drag cards to relocate them.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>On it!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutNeighbourhoods} onDismiss={arrangeNeighbourhoodReward}>
  <p>
    Residential cards provide housing for residents in your town. The
    <CardRef id="cat-neighbourhood" /> in particular has room for 6 <SpeciesRef id="cat" /> residents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each type of resident has different needs. When the needs of a resident are satisfied, their
    productivity increases and they will pay you more <MoneyRef />.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <SpeciesRef id="cat" /> requires 1 <ResourceRef id="bread" /> per day to be satisfied. Luckily,
    I have a <CardRef id="bakery" /> card already, which will allow us to produce that
    <ResourceRef id="bread" /> right here in town!
  </p>
  <p class="info">Place a <CardRef id="bakery" /> from your deck into your town.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Got it!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutBakery} onDismiss={placeBakeryReward}>
  <p>
    The <CardRef id="bakery" /> is a Production card. Production cards produce resources by consuming
    the resources of other cards nearby. To produce 5 units of <ResourceRef id="bread" />, the
    <CardRef id="bakery" /> uses 1 unit of <ResourceRef id="water" /> and 4 units of
    <ResourceRef id="flour" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we want this <CardRef id="bakery" /> working, we'll need to get our hands on those resources.
    I think I have a few more cards that might help with that, take a look and see what you can do.
  </p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Ok!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutSources} onDismiss={() => (step = "await-production")}>
  <p>
    The <CardRef id="water-well" /> and <CardRef id="wheat-farm" /> cards are both Source cards, meaning
    they are able to produce resources without needing to consume anything first. Instead, they allow
    you to harvest resources straight from the source.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the <CardRef id="water-well" /> is able to produce water from anywhere, the
    <CardRef id="wheat-farm" /> requires being placed on fertile <TerrainRef id="soil" /> in order to
    grow wheat.
  </p>
  <p class="info">Make sure your new cards are both producing.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Makes sense to me!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutTrade} onDismiss={aboutTradeReward}>
  <p>
    The <CardRef id="wheat-farm" /> is producing, but without a <CardRef id="flour-mill" /> in town,
    there's nothing for us to do with the <ResourceRef id="wheat" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily, I've got one last card here with me, it's a rare <CardRef id="trading-centre" /> card. You'll
    probably never get your hands on another one of these. This <CardRef id="trading-centre" />
    will become the backbone of our town, allowing us to sell our excess resources in exchange for
    <MoneyRef />.
  </p>
  <p class="info">Place the <CardRef id="trading-centre" />.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Wow!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutIncome} onDismiss={aboutIncomeReward}>
  <p>
    This is a world of production and trade, so all resources are reported in a rate of
    <strong>production per day</strong>. Other than <MoneyRef />, there's not much point in
    stockpiling any resources. Instead, and the end of each day, any excess resources we haven't
    used get exported via the <CardRef id="trading-centre" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <CardRef id="wheat-farm" /> produces 4 <ResourceRef id="wheat" /> per day, but a unit of
    <ResourceRef id="wheat" /> is worth just 1 <MoneyRef /> when exported. The
    <ResourceRef id="water" /> on the other hand isn't even worth selling. Unused resources aren't worth
    much!
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually most of your income will be coming from satisfied residents buying the things they
    need, but for now I'll just work out a deal real quick for your first export.

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutPacks}>
  <p>
    The other thing the <CardRef id="trading-centre" /> allows you to trade for is more cards. For a
    little bit of <MoneyRef />, you can buy a pack containing a few common cards which you can add
    to your town.
  </p>
  <p class="info">Open up the shop with the button at the bottom right.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>Exciting!</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={aboutShop}>
  <p>
    The shop offers new cards in <strong>Packs</strong>. The available packs are always changing,
    and each one contains a different assortment of cards, so be sure to check back often and buy
    any that catch your eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's one pack available right now, the <PackRef>Starter Pack</PackRef>, but I have a
    confession to make... I already opened it and gave you most of the cards. There's still one left
    though, I didn't want to take away all the fun!
  </p>
  <p class="info">Buy (the rest of) the <PackRef>Starter Pack</PackRef>.</p>

  {#snippet actions(dismiss)}
    <button onclick={dismiss}>That's ok...</button>
  {/snippet}
</TutorialDialog>

<TutorialDialog bind:this={complete}>
  <p>
    That's it, the <CardRef id="bakery" /> is finally able to make its <ResourceRef id="bread" />!
    You'll be on your own from here on out. I look forward to seeing where you take the town, and
    meeting all the people who will eventually move in! Good luck, and I hope you have fun!
